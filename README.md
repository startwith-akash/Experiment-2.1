### **Title**  
To implement a Live Character Counter using front-end technologies.

---

### **Approach**

In this experiment, a Live Character Counter was designed and implemented to display the number of characters entered by the user in real time. The main objective was to understand dynamic UI updates and user input handling.

* HTML was used to create the text area and display elements.  
* CSS was used to style the layout and provide visual feedback for character limits.  
* JavaScript/React was used to update the character count dynamically as the user types.  
* The `maxLength` attribute was used to restrict the number of characters and ensure proper validation.

This approach helps in understanding event handling, real-time updates, and basic front-end interactivity.

### **Learning Outcomes**

* Understood how to handle user input dynamically.  
* Learned to implement real-time updates using JavaScript/React state.  
* Gained knowledge of input validation using the `maxLength` attribute.  
* Improved understanding of styling interactive components using CSS.
